kill the FN and epic processes
run apple s3 cleaner (answer "n" to risk)
reboot
run advance event cleaner
run apex cleaner
run be eac fixer
run 1 button until web page comes up after it is done
run temp fixer
change my vpn server
reboot
run apple cleaner again (because windows likes to restore files sometimes if it sees a problem)
reboot again
spoof
load driver
steam with epic launcher
make new account
load FN and get to lobby and adjust settings
quit FN (because the initial run on new account isn't quite the same)
load FN again
load skill

Its probably overkill but never fails me.
